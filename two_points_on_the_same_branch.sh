# - Take advantage of the --show-actions:
#   - make sure that the user can provide OPAM packages (for benchmarking) in arbitrary order
#     (without resorting to brute-force method where, for each of the benchmarked package, we start from scratch (fresh OPAM-root containting just the right version of Coq))
# - Figure out how to separate `download`, `build` and `install` actions.
# - make sure that the user can provide OPAM packages (for benchmarking) in arbitrary order
#   (without resorting to brute-force method where, for each of the benchmarked package, we start from scratch (fresh OPAM-root containting just the right version of Coq))
# - remove the (in fact) superfluous argument of this script.
#   - remove it also from the corresponding Jenkins jobs
# - run benchmarks that compare Coq 8.5 and 8.6 (for those OPAM packages that be installed to either version)
# - check how Ocaml people tackled the same problem
# - documentation ... add missing bits
#   - Emilio's suggestions (https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/434)
#     - Indeed I would add a section such as "Interpreting the numbers: for a 4x job,
#       the numbers mean the minimum time of 4 executions of opam install package ."
#   - ThÃ©os suggestions
#     - explain why it makes sense to take minimum
# - track compilation times of individual files
# - send a message to coq-dev about the benchmarking machinery
# - check Travis ... what it is building ... whether we are tracking the same set
#   - vst
# - compile released versions (if there is no released version, let's create some some unnoficial tar.gz and use that)
#   instead of a HEAD of some branch
# - observe the dependency between
#   - the total benchmarking time wrt. the number of iterations
#   - the achieved precision wrt. the number of iterations
#   and documented this.
# - figure out what to do with the "coq-hott" package
#   - currently we clone (and patch) Emilio's branch which is patched version of some old commit of upstream
#   - what we would like to compile is the HEAD of the upstream master branch
#   - how can we do that?
#   - track HoTT via our "opam-install*" jobs
# - Simplify the Jenkins jobs:
#   - https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/coq-contribs/job/coq-contribs/
#   - https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/opam/job/opam-install/
#   - https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/benchmarking/job/benchmark-the-whole-branch/
#   - https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/benchmarking/job/benchmark-part-of-the-branch/
#   Instead of requiring to specify two pieces of clumsy data:
#   - the git repository
#   - the name of the branch
#   require just one string that identifies github repo and the branch and can be copy&pasted from the github's pull request:
#   e.g.:
# - TODO list mentioned here:
#   https://ci.inria.fr/coq/view/benchmarking/job/benchmark-the-whole-branch/
# - Compare our set of the tracked OPAM packages with the one tracked via Travis.
#   - start tracking:
#     - tlc
#     - coq-unicoq
#     - coq-metacoq
# - reuse the real *.opam file for Coq (we just need custom "url" file)
# - add checks that user-provided NEW and OLD values have the expected chronological order
#   (i.e. NEW is a more recent commit than OLD)
# - improve initial checks (whether our assumptions hold)
# - camlp{4,5} ... probably we do not need the fake "camlp4" and "camlp5" packages
#   (there is a way to tell OPAM to use the camlp4/5 available on the system instead of compiling/installing it when some package depends on it)
# - describe the effect of the commands in the  EXAMPLES section
# - Figure out some way to measure just the interpretation of "build" section.
#   (not interpretation of the "url" file or "install" section in the *.opam file)
#   Figure out how to avoid measuring downloading of the actual OPAM package that is being done during "opam install".
#   (even when all its dependencies were already installed by "opam install --deps-only ...")
#   (suggested also by https://github.com/matejkosik/coq-bench/issues/1)
# - shared/*.ml ... deal with the TODO list which is located there
# - there are are multiple ways how to improve repsonsibility (shorten the benchmarking time)
#   - what we actually want to do is:
#     - given some set of OPAM packages that the user is interested in to benchmark
#     - we should use an existing machinery to infer all the OPAM packages that need to be install so that we can benchmark
#       all the OPAM packages required by the user
#     - install all these OPAM packages in the topological order
#     - where benchmarked packages will be installed with "-j1" and one by one
#       and non-benchmarked packages (in the topological order in betweeen the two benchmarked packages)
#       will be installed with "-j4"
#       - Hmmm, now I realize that we could use more processors;
#         it could indeed contribute to the speedup (of installation of the non-benchmarked packages)
# - instead of abusing "opam" for the purposes for which it wasn't designed
#   ("opam" does not make it easy for me to test custom Coq branches)
#   make a cleaner implementation of this script by using some tool that directly supports what I need
#   (we can piggy-back on the ecosystem of "opam" and "url" file that is in place but shun the "opam" program which serves a different purpose)
# - merge these scripts under the Coq-organization umbrella (somewhere)
# - Maxime's suggestion:
#   - Maybe we could try a hybrid approach, like using opam to install dependencies, but do the build to be benchmarked manually.
#     This way, we would not need to create a fake package, we would have more control on what we measure,
#     but could still rely on OPAM to solve dependencies."
# - Emilio's suggestions
#   - we should benchmark every commit
#   - we should gather results per-file (rather than per OPAM package)
#   - we should gather and compare results per section or per sentence (sercomp will provide necessary mechanisms)
#   - We should benchmark every commit automatically and save the reports in a format that's easy to browse.
# - benchmarking results (for the official branches; for the released packages)
#   should be stored in some way to enable further proessing
#   - e.g. to display the trend for a given package
# - once we create v8.7 branch of Coq
#   - update:
#     - the "print_man_page" command
#     - the piece of code where we set the "official_coq_branch" variable
#     - the piece of code where we set the "coq_opam_version" variable
